## SCSS-Net: Solar Corona Structures Segmentation by Deep Learning

### Supplemental materials to the paper: (submitted to MNRAS, in review)

- Jupyter notebook [SCSS-net_CH](/SCSS-net_CH.ipynb) that contains analysis presented in the article related to the segmentation of coronal holes. The required utilities are in [/src](/src) folder.
- Jupyter notebook [SCSS-net_AR](/SCSS-net_AR.ipynb) that contains analysis related to the segmentation of active regions
- Visualization of SCSS-net performance to segment coronal holes on the test set is presented in [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/INGJu9yFl9s)
- Custom annotations of [coronal holes](/data/ch_custom.zip) and [active regions](/data/ar_custom.zip)
